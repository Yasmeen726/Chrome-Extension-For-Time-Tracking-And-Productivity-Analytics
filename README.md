*Task Description*:


The goal of this project is to develop a Chrome extension that tracks usersâ€™ time spent on different websites and provides productivity insights. This extension will help users analyze their browsing habits, differentiate between productive and distracting websites, and ultimately improve time management.

The extension consists of:

A popup interface that displays real-time stats and analytics.
A background script that continuously tracks active tab usage.
A content script (if needed) for additional user activity monitoring.
Chrome storage for saving time-tracking data.

Key Features
 Time Tracking
Monitors which websites are being visited and for how long.
Detects when the user is active or idle to avoid inaccurate time logs.
Logs total daily usage and time spent per website.

 Productivity Analytics
Categorizes websites into productive, neutral, or distracting (e.g., work tools vs. social media).
Generates daily and weekly reports on browsing habits.
Displays trends through charts and graphs.

 Popup UI for Quick Stats
Shows real-time data, including:
Current websiteâ€™s time usage.
Total browsing time for the day.
Top websites visited.
Allows users to reset or adjust time tracking settings.

 Background Script for Continuous Tracking
Runs in the background to monitor tab changes and URL updates.
Uses the Chrome Storage API to store website visit durations.
Ensures tracking continues even if the popup is closed.

 Content Script for Additional Interaction (If Needed)
Detects user activity (scrolling, mouse movement) to differentiate between active and idle time.
